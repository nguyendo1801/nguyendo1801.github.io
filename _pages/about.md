Welcome to my personal website! I am Do Hoang Khoi Nguyen (Nguyen Do), currently a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the **University of Florida**, where I work in the **Adaptive and Optimization Lab** under the supervision of Professor **My T. Thai**. My research brings together ideas from **reinforcement learning**, **combinatorial optimization**, **generative models**, and **Mixture-of-Experts architectures**, with a growing interest in applying them to real-world systems like **photonic-on-chip networks**.

I‚Äôm especially drawn to problems that sit at the boundary between learning and structured decision-making ‚Äî where models not only need to perform well but also make reliable, explainable decisions under uncertainty. I enjoy designing systems that are both **scalable** and **theoretically sound**, where performance isn‚Äôt just about high scores, but also about understanding **why** and **how** a model behaves. In practice, this has led me to build frameworks that combine RL with generative modeling for tasks like **influence maximization**, **anomaly detection**, or **controllable chip design**, often using ideas like **graph neural networks**, **latent dynamics**, or **energy-guided inference**. I like models that adapt, reason, and can be trusted in dynamic or noisy environments ‚Äî especially when applied to domains beyond software, such as networks or hardware.

Overall, I care about building AI systems that are not only intelligent, but **intelligible**, and grounded in both theory and practical relevance.
