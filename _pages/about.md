Welcome to my personal website! I am Do Hoang Khoi Nguyen (Nguyen Do), currently a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the **University of Florida**, where I work in the **Adaptive and Optimization Lab** under the supervision of Professor **My T. Thai**.

My research lies at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning**, **Combinatorial Optimization**, **Generative AI**, **Mixture-of-Experts**, and **AI-driven Silicon Photonics Design**. I am particularly interested in developing scalable, theoretically grounded models that not only achieve strong empirical performance but also provide convergence guarantees or approximation bounds in real-world applications.
