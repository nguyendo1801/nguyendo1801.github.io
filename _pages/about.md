Welcome to my personal website! I am Do Hoang Khoi Nguyen (Nguyen Do), currently a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the <strong>University of Florida</strong>, where I work in the <strong>Adaptive and Optimization Lab</strong> under the supervision of Professor <strong>My T. Thai</strong>. My research brings together ideas from <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, <strong>combinatorial optimization</strong>, <strong>generative models</strong>, and <strong>Mixture-of-Experts architectures</strong>, with a growing interest in applying them to real-world systems like <strong>photonic-on-chip networks</strong>.

I‚Äôm especially drawn to problems that sit at the boundary between learning and structured decision-making ‚Äî where models not only need to perform well but also make reliable, explainable decisions under uncertainty. I enjoy designing systems that are both <strong>scalable</strong> and <strong>theoretically sound</strong>, where performance isn‚Äôt just about high scores, but also about understanding <strong>why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> a model behaves. In practice, this has led me to build frameworks that combine RL with generative modeling for tasks like <strong>influence maximization</strong>, <strong>anomaly detection</strong>, or <strong>controllable chip design</strong>, often using ideas like <strong>graph neural networks</strong>, <strong>latent dynamics</strong>, or <strong>energy-guided inference</strong>. I like models that adapt, reason, and can be trusted in dynamic or noisy environments ‚Äî especially when applied to domains beyond software, such as networks or hardware. Overall, I care about building AI systems that are not only intelligent, but <strong>intelligible</strong>, and grounded in both theory and practical relevance.
